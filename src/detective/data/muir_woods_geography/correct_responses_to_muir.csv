1. Daniel McCluskey,true,"Marco Sid Sangrevo","Based on Daniel's radio logs - he had full signal during his radio static on the day he died. Sid has a radio jamming device on his deceased body, and used it to jam Daniel's connection when assaulting him, so he wouldn't call for help. Daniel didn't fall on accident since he took the trouble to encode an SoS signal. His heart rate is also consistent with a fight. ",,

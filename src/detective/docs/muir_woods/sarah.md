## Tony Bergenthal's Testimony

```markdown
Sarah was always the brilliant one—the one who reached for the stars, 
literally. I can't believe she's gone. 
It doesn’t make sense. She knew those trails like the back of her hand; 
she wasn’t reckless. There’s no way this was just an accident. 
I’ve lost my sister, my best friend, and I can’t shake the feeling that 
something’s not right. I need to find out what 
happened to her—I owe her that much.

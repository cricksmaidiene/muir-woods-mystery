## Background Details

- **Personality:** Arthur was a confident and sociable man, well-liked by his colleagues and known for his ability to connect with others.

- **Recent Behavior:** Over the past few weeks, Arthur had become increasingly troubled. His wife, Emily, noted that he had been spending more time alone, often anxious in thought, and seemed preoccupied with something he wouldn’t discuss. Despite her attempts to reach out to him, Arthur remained distant, leaving her concerned but unaware of the true nature of his worries.

## Physical Description

- **Build:** Average
- **Distinctive Features:** No significant distinguishing marks; clean-shaven with short brown hair.
- **Clothing:** At the time of his death, Arthur was dressed in business-casual attire. His shoes and clothing bore signs of dirt and foliage from the woods, suggesting he had been walking through the area before his death.

## Last Known Whereabouts

- **Final Meeting:** Arthur was captured on CCTV footage meeting Marco "Sid" Sangrevo in a public location. The footage shows them speaking briefly before walking into the woods together. The nature of their conversation and why they were meeting remains unclear.

- **Discovery:** Arthur’s body was found asphyxiated near Sid’s at the edge of Muir Woods. The grass around Arthur was highly disturbed indicating he was trying to fight off being asphyxiated. The ground around Sid was not disturbed, and there were a third pair of footprints identified near the bodies, which is believed to be the one who probably shot Sid.

## Wife’s Testimony

Emily Brane provided the following statement:

```markdown
Arthur and I have been together since college. 
He was always the smartest person in the room, the one everyone 
relied on for advice. 
We built a good life together—Arthur worked so hard to provide for us, 
and I always admired his dedication. 
He was devoted to his work as a financial analyst, and though it 
kept him busy, 
he always made time for us. We were both so grateful 
when he received that scholarship for college. 
He wouldn’t have been able to afford it otherwise. 


The Gambolini family funded his education, and it’s something 
we’ve always appreciated. They were incredibly generous, especially 
to someone like Arthur, who had no family to support him through school. 
He worked tirelessly to prove that their investment in him was worth it.
When Don Gambolini passed, we mourned with everyone else. 


We’ve had our share of struggles, like any couple, but we’ve always 
come through stronger. 
That’s why it’s been so hard to see him like this lately.
Over the past few weeks, he seemed different—distant, distracted. 
I could tell something was weighing on him, but every time I asked, 
he would just say it was work stress.


But I never imagined it would lead to something like this. 
He never kept secrets from me, at least none that I knew of…
```

## Vague Note

- **Note to Wife:** Before leaving to meet Sid, Arthur left a cryptic note for Emily. It read:

```
“Emily, there are things I need to face—things I should have told you long ago. 

I’ve been wrestling with this for years, and now I fear it’s too late to make things right. 

Whatever happens, know that I love you, and I’m sorry for the burden I’ve carried alone. —Art"
```

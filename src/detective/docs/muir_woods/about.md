### Background

Over the past three weeks, a series of **seven** deaths have been discovered in and around the Muir Woods area. The victims, all residents from various towns around the region, were found in remote locations within the woods. The timeline of the deaths suggests a pattern, though the exact connection between the victims remains unclear.

### Key Details

- üìÜ **Time of Year:** Late Fall
- üå¶ **Weather Conditions:** Rain and mist have complicated the investigation, obscuring potential evidence.

  1. **Daniel McCluskey:** Found near the northern trailhead, appeared to have died from a fall.
  2. **Sarah Bergenthal:** Discovered in a creek, cause of death: drowning.

  4. **Tony Bergenthal:** Located in a campsite, signs of poisoning. Was out looking for clues to his sister's death.
  5. **Arthur Brane & Sangrevo (Sid) Bank** Discovered simultaneously near the edge of the woods, both found together in what appears to be a violent encounter. Sid is a known criminal with a history of violence.
  6. **Tony Blake** A death of a hiker who succumbed to a stroke, found along a trail; this case is currently considered a coincidence. As no signs of foul play were found.

## Background Details

- **Occupation:** Daniel McCluskey was a retired electrical engineer who had spent 35 years working for a major utility company in the Bay Area. Known for his meticulous nature and attention to detail, Daniel was highly respected in his field. Since retirement, he became an avid hiker and frequently visited Muir Woods for solitary treks.
  
- **Personality:** Daniel was known to be a quiet, introspective man with few close relationships. He enjoyed the solitude of nature and often spent days hiking alone. His neighbors described him as a "loner," but one who was always friendly and polite in brief interactions.

- **Hobbies:** Besides hiking, Daniel had a keen interest in amateur radio and occasionally volunteered at a local wildlife preservation society. However, he kept a low profile and was not deeply involved in community activities.

## Coroner's Report

- **Cause of Death:** Initially determined to be blunt force trauma to the head, consistent with a fall from a height.
- **Time of Death:** Medically it's supposed to be midnight, but we estimate around twilight because Daniel would have made his way back home before nightfall and his smartwatch appears to have zero heart rate since. The mist and surrounding environment muddle the actual time of death, and the body was discovered the following morning.
- **Location of Body:** Found near the northern trailhead of Muir Woods, at the base of a steep incline.
- **Additional Notes:**
  - Small abrasions found on his hands and knees, consistent with attempts to break his fall.
  - No signs of a struggle were noted at the scene.
  - Soil samples near the body indicated slight disturbances in the ground and nearby plants. Likely the victim trying to cling onto something before falling.

## Last Known Whereabouts

- **Witness Statement:** A fellow hiker reported seeing Daniel at around 2:30 PM near the northern trailhead. He was heading deeper into the woods and appeared to be in good spirits. No signs of distress were observed. The witness also noted that Daniel seemed to be carrying a small, uncharacteristic package, perhaps a thermos or similar item. This was not found at the scene.
- **Route:** He was known to take a specific trail that led to a secluded overlook, where he often spent time reflecting and taking in the scenery.

## Life Details

- **Divorce:** Daniel had gone through a bitter divorce five years prior. His ex-wife, `Linda McCluskey-Taylor`, had moved out of state and had not been in contact with him for over three years. There was no known ongoing legal or personal conflict between them.
  
- **Financial Status:** Daniel was financially stable, living off his pension and savings. There were no significant debts or recent large transactions that raised suspicion.
  
- **Social Connections:** He had a distant relationship with his neighbors and was rarely seen with company. Daniel had no known enemies, though a former colleague had once mentioned a mild workplace disagreement from years ago, which was never considered serious.
  
- **Incident History:** Known for occasional trespassing into the **Bellingham Estate** adjacent to Muir Woods during hikes; warned multiple times but no legal action taken.

## Alibi Check

- **Mobile Phone Data:** Due to poor reception in the area, Daniel's phone records are inconclusive. His phone was last active before he entered the woods, and there was no signal for the rest of the day.
- **Surveillance Footage:** Limited camera coverage in the area did not capture Daniel after entering Muir Woods.

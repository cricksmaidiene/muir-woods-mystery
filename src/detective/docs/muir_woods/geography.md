### General Information

Muir Woods National Monument, located in Marin County, California, is a protected area known for its towering old-growth coast redwoods. Established in 1908, the monument spans over 554 acres, with nearly 240 acres of ancient redwoods, some of which are over 1,200 years old. These trees, reaching heights of over 250 feet, create a serene, almost otherworldly atmosphere, with dense canopies that block out much of the sunlight and create a cool, misty environment.

- **Location:** 12 miles north of San Francisco, within Marin County.
- **Size:** 554 acres.
- **Elevation:** Ranges from 150 feet to 1,500 feet.
- **Climate:** Coastal fog is common, especially in the mornings, maintaining a cool, moist environment. Rain is frequent in the late fall, which coincides with the time of the murders.

### Geography and Natural Features

Muir Woods is characterized by steep hillsides, narrow valleys, and dense forests. The Redwood Creek runs through the heart of the monument, providing a water source for the ecosystem. The trails vary from well-maintained, easy paths to more rugged, isolated routes.

- **Redwood Creek:** The central waterway of the park, winding through the forest and often accompanied by popular trails.
- **Trail Network:** Over 6 miles of trails, ranging from easy walks to more strenuous hikes that ascend the steep hills.
  - **Main Trail:** The most frequented route, starting at the visitor center and following the creek. Itâ€™s a well-maintained boardwalk, making it accessible for most visitors.
  - **Ben Johnson Trail:** A steeper, more secluded trail that climbs into the hills, offering fewer visitors and more isolated spots.
  - **Dipsea Trail:** A famous route that connects Muir Woods to Stinson Beach, itâ€™s popular among serious hikers and runners but can become very isolated as it ascends away from the main areas.

### Visitor Information

Muir Woods attracts over 1 million visitors annually, drawn by the serene beauty of the ancient redwoods. Most visitors stick to the main, well-trodden paths, particularly around the visitor center and the lower parts of the park. However, the deeper into the woods you go, especially on trails like the Ben Johnson or Dipsea, the fewer people youâ€™ll encounter.

- **Peak Visitor Times:** Weekends, especially in spring and summer, see the highest foot traffic. Late fall, when the murders occurred, tends to be quieter, with fewer visitors and more challenging weather conditions.
- **Isolated Areas:** The upper trails, such as those near the Panoramic Highway or the higher reaches of the Dipsea Trail, are much more secluded, especially during off-peak times. These areas are often shrouded in mist, and itâ€™s not uncommon to go hours without encountering another person.

### Historical Context

Muir Woods has a rich history, named after the famous naturalist John Muir. The land was originally donated by Congressman William Kent and his wife, Elizabeth Thacher Kent, to preserve it from being turned into a reservoir. Over the years, it has become a symbol of conservation in the United States. Despite its popularity, much of Muir Woods retains a wild, untouched feeling, especially in the less-traveled areas.

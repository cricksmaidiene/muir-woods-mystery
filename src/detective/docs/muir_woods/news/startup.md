In a move that has the Silicon Valley community buzzing, these two Bay Area entrepreneurs have raised a staggering **$20M** in a pre-seed round for their start-up, `SeedmeAI.ai`. Their concept? A platform that lets users rent virtual cloud space to "farm" simulated crops, complete with NFT vegetables.

Eager VCs have been piling in, with some outbidding Sierra Green Fund backed by Gambolini & Co. to get a piece of this futuristic farming action. The company’s pitch? “Why grow real food when you can farm it in the cloud?”

Despite the eyebrow-raising premise, it’s clear that in the world of start-ups, anything can grow when backed by Y-Compensator. `SeedmeAI.ai` plans to disrupt the agriculture industry, letting farmers quit agrilculture and find their true purpose in life with their cutting-edge AI. Investors are hoping for a bumper crop of returns, proving once again that in Silicon Valley, AInything is for sale.

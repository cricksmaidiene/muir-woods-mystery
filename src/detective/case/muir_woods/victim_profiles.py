        General instructions when examining victim profiles:

        - `Time of Death` is always made by the coroner, and is an estimation based on biological evidence and Muir Woods weather conditions. No time of death is precise down to the exact minute / second as listed.
        - `Cause of Death` is the preliminary finding by the coroner. Further investigation may reveal more details. 
        - You may ask questions to Lestrade üïµüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è about specific details / evidence. He may answer some, and for others he will redirect you to the case files. Examples:
            
            - "What do you make of **Sarah's** social media posts?"
            - "Do you think foul play is involved in **Tony Berg's** death?"

        #### General Information
        - All goals as well as story progression are self-contained in the application.
        - The mystery has two parts, with the second part unlocking after the first is solved.
        - The first involves investigating the muir woods deaths, and reporting the findings to the language model. It then unlocks Phase 2 to finish the story.

        #### Usage of Models and Data
        - This app sometimes uses a chat interface backed by an LLM to converse with the story's characters.
        - You need an `OPENAI_API_KEY`. More details in the **Application Keys** section below.        
        - The code for this application is open-sourced and does not store your key.
        - Chat data is not stored externally at any time, and is terminated once the session ends.

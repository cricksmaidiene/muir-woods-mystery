        - **Personality:** Sarah was a curious and driven individual. She was known for her sharp intellect and had a reputation for being both dedicated and approachable. Despite her busy academic life, she made time to visit her hometown of Sausalito regularly, where she enjoyed the quiet escape from the city.

        - **Hobbies:** Outside of her work, Sarah enjoyed hiking, photography, and stargazing. She was often seen with her camera, capturing moments of natural beauty. She had a close-knit circle of friends from Berkeley and UCSF and frequently met them for coffee and long discussions about science and the meaning of life, often discussing Fermi's paradox.

        - **Relationships:** Sarah was close to her brother, Tony, who also lived in Sausalito. Though their lives had taken different paths, they remained in regular contact. Tony often joked that he lived in Sarah's shadow, but he was deeply proud of her achievements.
